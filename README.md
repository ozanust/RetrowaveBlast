# RetrowaveBlast

An old game of mine. One can play the game from; https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xg.retrowaveblast

It won't resemble my present technical experience but it includes some of the game mechanics and performance optimizations that I would want to show.
The main music was composed by one of my sound composer friend.
UI and graphics are also customly designed for this game according to information I provided about what kind of game I am thinking. Again by my 3D/UI artist friend.
There are no copy/past code, no ready-to-use code. All implemented by me.

I am opening this repo to public to show my knowledge and experience regarding the mobile game development.
